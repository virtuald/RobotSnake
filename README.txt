RobotSnake directions
=====================

Each team is composed of one or more students. Each team has their
own directory and launcher file. 

Rules:

    - Students may modify anything in their teams' directory. 
    - They must NOT modify any files elsewhere

Each team will have their own git repository to commit their files to, 
and will not be allowed access to each others repositories at this
time. 

Launching your robot
====================

Run the following command on Windows, substituting X with your team number:

    launch.bat teamX

Or on OSX/Linux:

    ./launch.sh teamX
